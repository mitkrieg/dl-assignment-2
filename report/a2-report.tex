\section{Theory: Question 3 [10 pts]}

In a LSTM cell there are 4 different gates each with its own learnable parameters. For a LSTM with an input of 200 and a hidden state of 200 each gate will have an input weight matrix of 200x200 so that the output of the gate will be a vector of 200 units. The same is true for the hidden state weight matrix. Lastly, each gate has a bias vector of 200. So for one gate there will be 200x200 + 200x200 + 200 = 80200 parameters. Since there are 4 gates, we can multiply this number by 4 to get the total number of 80200 x 4 = 320400 parameters in the LSTM cell.
